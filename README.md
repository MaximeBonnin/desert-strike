# Desert Strike

This game is a copy of a Starcraft 2 arcade mode called "Desert Strike".

I want to recreate it using pygame.

  * area for unit spawns (done)
  * scrolling
  * more than 2 players
* Have units spawn
  * "ghost" units dont walk (done)
  * "ghosts" get copied on round start (done)
  * ability to move units in spawn area (done)
  * good looking buttons
* Have units walk towars eachother and fight
  * track position / collisions (done)
  * move (done)
  * find valid attack targets (done)
  * attack (done)
  * have target die (done)
  * aggro instead of just walk
* Have good UI
  * Self explanatory buttons (kinda done)
  * Player info
